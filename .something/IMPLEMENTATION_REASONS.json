The module provides standardized error codes (MODULE_NOT_FOUND, CONFIGURATION_ERROR, FFI_BINDING_ERROR, VALIDATION_ERROR, TIMEOUT_ERROR, RESOURCE_ERROR), graceful error handling with vim.notify integration, input validation functions, and safe execution wrappers. This addresses REQ-3 from the technical design for robust error handling and ensures the plugin fails gracefully rather than crashing.",
