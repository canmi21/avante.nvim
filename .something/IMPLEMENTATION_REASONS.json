    "content": "Created a comprehensive error handling module following Neovim plugin best practices. The module provides standardized error codes, graceful error handling with vim.notify integration, input validation functions, and safe execution wrappers. This addresses the simulation requirement for robust error handling and ensures the plugin fails gracefully rather than crashing.",

    "content": "Implemented a comprehensive performance benchmarking system to meet the simulation requirements for measuring startup time, memory usage, and operation performance. The benchmarking module provides high-precision timing using vim.uv.hrtime, memory profiling with garbage collection control, and comprehensive reporting. This enables validation of performance targets like <100ms startup time and <50MB memory usage.",
