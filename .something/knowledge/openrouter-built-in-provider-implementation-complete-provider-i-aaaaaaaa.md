## OpenRouter Implementation Complete

The OpenRouter built-in provider has been successfully implemented in Avante.nvim with the following components:

### 1. Provider Module Structure
- Located at `lua/avante/providers/openrouter.lua`
- Uses `__inherited_from = "openai"` pattern for maximum code reuse
- Includes all required configuration fields: endpoint, model, api_key_name, timeout, context_window, extra_request_body

### 2. Configuration Integration
- Added to `lua/avante/config.lua` in the providers section (lines 416-428)
- Follows `---@type AvanteSupportedProvider` annotation pattern
- Uses cost-effective default model `openai/gpt-4o-mini`

### 3. Type System Integration
- Added `---@field openrouter AvanteProviderFunctor` to `lua/avante/providers/init.lua`
- Updated Provider type alias in README.md to include "openrouter"

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Added both scoped (`AVANTE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) and standard (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) environment variable documentation
- Included OpenRouter in the supported providers list

### 5. Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive test suite at `tests/providers/openrouter_spec.lua`
- Tests cover all configuration fields and inheritance patterns
- Follows existing test patterns from other providers

### Best Practices Demonstrated
- **Inheritance over Reimplementation**: Leverages existing OpenAI provider infrastructure
- **Consistent Configuration**: Follows established provider configuration patterns
- **Type Safety**: Includes proper type annotations for IDE support
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for all configuration aspects
- **Documentation First**: Clear setup instructions for both API key patterns

This implementation serves as a reference for adding other OpenAI-compatible providers in the future.
